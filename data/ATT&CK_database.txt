128,T1055,Process Injection,"Adversaries may inject code into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges.",res://images/card_images/attack/Process Injection.png,2
129,T1572,Protocol Tunneling,Adversaries may tunnel network communications to and from a victim system within a separate protocol to avoid detection/network filtering and/or enable access to otherwise unreachable systems. Tunneling involves explicitly encapsulating a protocol within another. This behavior may conceal malicious traffic by blending in with existing traffic and/or provide an outer layer of encryption (similar to a VPN).,res://images/card_images/attack/Protocol Tunneling.png,2
130,T1090,Proxy,"Adversaries may use a connection proxy to direct network traffic between systems or act as an intermediary for network communications to a command and control server to avoid direct connections to their infrastructure.

",res://images/card_images/attack/Rootkit x5.png,2
141,T1053,Scheduled Task/Job,"Adversaries may abuse task scheduling functionality to facilitate initial or recurring execution of malicious code. Utilities exist within all major operating systems to schedule programs or scripts to be executed at a specified date and time.

They may do this, for example, by retrieving account usernames or by using OS Credential Dumping.",res://images/card_images/attack/System Owner or User Discovery.png,2
162,T1216,System Script Proxy Execution,"Adversaries may use trusted scripts, often signed with certificates, to proxy the execution of malicious files. Several Microsoft signed scripts that have been downloaded from Microsoft or are default on Windows installations can be used to proxy execution of other files. This behavior may be abused by adversaries to execute malicious files that could bypass application control and signature validation on systems.",res://images/card_images/attack/System Script Proxy Execution.png,2
163,T1569,System Services,"Adversaries may abuse system services or daemons to execute commands or programs. Adversaries can execute malicious content by interacting with or creating services either locally or remotely.
